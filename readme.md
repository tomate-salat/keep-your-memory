# Keep Your Memory

## Idea
Have you ever forgotten something? The answer is probably yes because the time erases memories from our head. Sometimes it is good to forget. Sometimes it is healthy. 

But not if you are the memory time wants to erase. In this game you have to do everything to not become forgotten!

Everything takes place in a surreal environment where a clock is spawning time bombs. They are coming for you with one simple goal: to blow you up!

## Unity
This project was created with Unity 2019.3.13f1.
